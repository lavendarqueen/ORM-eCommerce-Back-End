## Description

This is an eCommerce Back End application using object-relational mapping, a postgresSQL database, and Sequelize intended to help companies compete in e-Commerce. I built this project because I wanted to learn more about databases and server side functionality. In addition to learning postgresSQL and Sequelize, I also learned about routes and CRUD functions(Create, Read, Update, and Delete).

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, PostgreSQL username, and PostgreSQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the PostgreSQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database -->
