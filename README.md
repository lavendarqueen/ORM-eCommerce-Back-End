## Description

This is an eCommerce Back End application using object-relational mapping, a postgresSQL database, and Sequelize intended to help smaller companies compete in e-Commerce . I built this project because I wanted to learn more about databases and server side functionality. In addition to learning postgresSQL and Sequelize, I also learned about routes and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) functions.

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a functional Express.js API

THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the PostgreSQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
